# Currency converter

## About the project

Project developed with **React JS** using **Bootstrap** to handle styling. An API (Fixer.io) was consumed using **Axios** to query current exchange rates. In this project, I was able to use the **TDD process** with **Jest** to avoid bugs and exercise that process.
